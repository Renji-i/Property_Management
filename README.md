# Property_Management
This project involves creating a Dockerized PostgreSQL database to manage real estate listings. It stores property details, owner and tenant information, and their relationships. The system optimizes data handling, supports scalable queries, and enables efficient property search and reporting, all within a portable Docker environment.
